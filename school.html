      After graduating from Clearbrook High School in 2019, I attended San
      Jacinto Community College for two years to complete my core courses. I
      then transferred to the University of Houston's Cullen College of
      Engineering, where I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer
      Engineering. I have been at UH for about three years, or six semesters,
      and during this time, I have learned how to effectively use my resources
      to my advantage. I've come to realize that simply listening to lectures is
      not enough for certain tough courses. To truly understand the material, I
      have found it helpful to form study groups and supplement my learning with
      additional resources. As a student, it is also important to be involved
      and take advantage of opportunities to network through events,
      organizations, and career fairs. Building connections is crucial for
      success in college and beyond.

      I was initially interested in learning about programming and had a passion
      for math and problem solving, so I decided to pursue engineering. As I
      researched different engineering disciplines, I became interested in
      electrical engineering because of its relevance in a digital world that
      relies heavily on electricity. However, as I learned more about computer
      engineering, I realized that it combines both computer science and
      electrical engineering and offers even more opportunities. I decided to
      switch my major to computer engineering because I believed it was the
      perfect fit for my interests and goals.
