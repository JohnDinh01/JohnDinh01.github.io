    <h2>Get to know me</h2>

    <p>
      My name is John Dinh, and I am a Computer Engineering student at the
      University of Houston. I expect to graduate in Spring 2024. As a member of
      the Society of Asian Scientists & Engineers (SASE) and the Asian Business
      Student Association (ABSA), I have had the opportunity to expand my
      network by establishing meaningful and positive connections.

      In addition to my studies, I am also a self-employed tutor, helping
      students understand fundamental concepts through personalized lesson
      plans. Staying active is very important to me, and I incorporate it in my
      daily life by engaging in sports such as tennis and football, going to the
      gym, and simply spending time outdoors. I also enjoy the peace and
      serenity that come with going fishing, as it allows me to clear my mind
      and connect with nature. Aside from physical activity, I also prioritize
      personal growth and development by reading self-improvement books and
      seeking out new perspectives. Some of my favorite TV shows include Money
      Heist, Ozark, and Friends.

      As a computer engineering student, I am committed to expanding my
      knowledge and skills in front-end development. To achieve this goal, I
      plan to take relevant online courses to deepen my understanding of
      technologies such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I will also be working on
      personal projects to improve my skills and to have a portfolio to
      showcase. Additionally, I will be actively seeking internships as a
      software developer to gain practical experience and make industry
      connections.
